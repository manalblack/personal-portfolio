E-commerce platform (
    To speed up the development process i used javascript on both the Frontend and Backend.
   Used React in the frontend for it's component based nature akin to building blocks, the ability to use the same component reputedly makes the development process extremely fast, and it's clear documentation and large ecosystem.
   Firebase Authentication was utilized to handle user sign-ups and logins, ensuring a secure user experience
    for the backend used Node.js/Express.js to create RESTfull API to communicate easily with my mongodb database which i used for it's flexible capabilities
